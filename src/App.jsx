//RECQUIREMENTS
// 1. Your app should have at least two pages - one showing a list of movies and one showing details

// 2. You should follow the design from our example (but it's ok to change things - just try to make it look nice).

// 3. Adapting to the different viewports

//INTERMEDIATE stretch goals

// 4. Show a 'not found' page if you try to visit a movie detail page with an invalid movie ID (so the user has tried 
// to enter an ID themselves, most likely).

   //* In this case, when you send a movie detail request with a movie ID which doesn't exist in the API, 
   //the API returns with a 404 response. You can use .catch() on your promise to catch this exception and 
   //toggle some sort of 'error' state which can be used to show an error page.

// 5. Handle loading states - The API responds quite quickly, but if you're on a slow network then you'd be faced 
// with a black screen until the response comes back. During this time, you could show a loading message or spinner 
// of some sort on the page.

  // * Use something like const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true) to make it so the page is loading by default, 
  //then call setLoading(false) once you get the response back from the API.

  // * You could also investigate how to handle the loading of images - or show plain text by default and then use CSS to place the image over the text (using absolute positioning). This way, if the images take a long time to load, the user still sees something relevant.

  // ADVANCED stretch goals

// 6. On the homepage where you list popular movies, you could add a dropdown to change the list. For example, you could 
// toggle between popular, upcoming, and new releases.

// 7. When you load a movie, you get a lot of information in the API response, such as a collection it belongs to, genres 
//it has, or the companies involved with producing the film. Each of these has an API endpoint that can be used to fetch more 
//information about that entity. You could use this data to make links from your movie page to another page. Take a look through 
//the documentation and be creative! Example: Some movies have a list of production companies. You could iterate over this list 
//and add a link to each production company to your page. Then, when the user clicks the link, they go to another page that loads 
//information about that production company and perhaps a list of films which theyâ€™ve produced.
